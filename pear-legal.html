	<p>
		Welcome to <a href="https://pear.buiders">pear.builders</a>. This page explains the terms by which you may use the online and/or mobile services, web site, and software provided on or in connection with the service (collectively, the <b>"Service"</b> or <b>"Pear"</b>).

	</p>

	<p>Your account on the Service (your <b>"User Account"</b>) gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of User Accounts for different types of Users. If you open a User Account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (i) "you" includes you and that entity, and (ii) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity's behalf.

When creating your User Account, you must provide accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date.
